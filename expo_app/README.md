This folder is a minimal Expo React Native scaffold to build an Android APK later.
## To build APK (high level)
1. Install Node.js and npm
2. Install expo-cli: `npm install -g expo-cli`
3. From this folder run: `npm install`
4. Start: `expo start`
5. To build a production Android app you can use Expo Application Services (EAS) or `eas build -p android`
