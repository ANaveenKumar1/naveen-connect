Naveen Connect - Full Package (Web prototype + Expo Android prep)

This package contains two folders:
  - web_prototype: lightweight React + Vite prototype for quick demos (open in browser)
  - expo_app: minimal Expo scaffold to prepare Android build (needs Expo & npm)

Next steps I can do for you:
  1) Upload these files to your GitHub repository (I will guide you step-by-step)
  2) Create a GitHub repo and push the project (I can prepare the commits for you)
  3) Build an APK using Expo (I can prepare CI steps or do it for you)

Tell me which next step you want.
